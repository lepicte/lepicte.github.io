I"r<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I will do a quick and dirty post about what’s out there to find / prevent leaks of secrets in your git repositories.<br />
I did not try all of these tools. For the search part, i’m mainly using a fork of Trufflehog with some added features (search in filenames, commits comments, also with custom regexes).</p>

<h3 id="objectives-">Objectives :</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Look into the commits history for sensitive information publicly accessible by an attacker ;</li>
  <li>Prevent secrets leaks ;</li>
  <li>Monitoring and integrating these checks in the Continous Delivery process - aka DevSecOps</li>
</ul>
