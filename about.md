Welcome on this blog dealing with posts about infosec.

**Who is the dude?**
  
I was a web applications developper for several years and infosec fanatic before i was born and now working in this fascinating field.  
For the french dudes, may be HZV, Hackademy Mag & School, Zataz, NDH sounds familiar.  
  
I'm also an open-source contributor ([mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy), [windapsearch](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch), [PowerUpSQL](https://github.com/NetSPI/PowerUpSQL), ...) - check my [github](https://github.com/phackt).  
I also love sport, traveling, socializing and personal development.
